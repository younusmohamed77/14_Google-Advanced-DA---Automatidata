The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month. \n",

For this taxi data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month.

    "### Methods for Identifying Outliers\n",
    "#### Visual Methods:\n",
    "##### 1. Boxplots: \n",
    "- Identify observations outside the whiskers (typically 1.5 times the interquartile range from the first and third quartiles).\n",
    "##### 2. Scatter plots: \n",
    "- Look for points that are far away from the main cluster of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Methods:\n",
    "##### 1. Z-Score: \n",
    "- Calculate the z-score for each data point. Points with a z-score greater than a threshold (e.g., 3) are considered outliers.\n",
    "##### 2. Interquartile Range (IQR): \n",
    "Define outliers as points that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Machine Learning Methods:\n",
    "- Clustering algorithms: Identify points that do not belong to any cluster.\n",
    "- Isolation Forest: Anomaly detection algorithm that isolates outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision to Keep or Exclude Outliers\n",
    "#### Understand the Nature of Outliers:\n",
    "- Genuine vs. Error: Determine if outliers represent genuine extreme values or are errors in data collection or measurement.\n",
    "#### Impact on Analysis:\n",
    "- Model Sensitivity: Assess how sensitive your model is to outliers. Some models, like linear regression, can be heavily influenced by outliers.\n",
    "- Domain Knowledge: Consider if outliers are meaningful in the context of your analysis. For example, in financial data, extreme values might be important indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Strategies:\n",
    "- Exclude Outliers: If outliers are likely due to data entry errors or measurement issues and are not representative of the phenomenon being studied.\n",
    "- Transform Data: Apply transformations (e.g., logarithmic) to reduce the impact of outliers.\n",
    "- Robust Models: Use models that are less sensitive to outliers, such as tree-based methods or robust regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "By carefully considering these factors, we can make informed decisions regarding outliers that optimize the robustness and reliability of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I thinking using box plots and the IQR method are best for identifying outliers.\n",
    "- Depending on the spread and nature of the variables, we decide to handle the outliers by either changing the outliers to the extreme values of the IQR or any of the measures of central tendencies."
